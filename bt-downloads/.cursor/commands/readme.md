If the file _src/_README.md exists, update that file instead of README.md. If not, then make changes to README.md.

Update src/_README.md or README.md with recent changes. Pay attention to the existing structure and add new features and options in logical places in the document structure.

If a wiki is included in the project (*.wiki), you can link relevant notes in the README to appropriate wiki pages.
