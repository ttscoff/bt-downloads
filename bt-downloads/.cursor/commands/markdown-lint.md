Parse all Markdown files in the project and ensure:

1. Wrap text at {{ variables.width | default: 60}}
   characters, but don't break links or code spans. Don't
   wrap inside of fenced code blocks. If you wrap a list
   item, make sure it's indented properly. If you wrap a
   block quote line, ensure that the new line starts with >.
2. Ensure a blank newline before and after code blocks
3. Ensure a blank line before and after lists, except in the
   case of nested lists. If a list item contains a
   paragraph, make sure that wrapped lines include proper
   indentation.
