Write a commit message marking the current state as Work in Progress (WIP). Save the commit message to commit_message.txt, then run `git commit -a -F commit_message.txt`.

Include a list of what's been changed since the last commit, and what isn't currently working (especially failing tests) as a note on the commit.
